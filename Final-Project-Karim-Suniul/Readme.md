# Project Description
In this project, we will be working on a simple back-end API (via REST and GraphQL) inventory management web service for a video game store. Our group of 3-4 learners will be developing this application using agile techniques.

As a team, we will be responsible for designing and documenting the API, as well as implementing the controllers, service, layering, repository, Java data objects, and unit tests for the application based on the provided database structure. This project will give us hands-on experience in building a scalable and functional API and working collaboratively with other developers in an agile environment.

We are excited to work on this project and get real usage out of the things we've learned over the course of our bootcamp.
